### Assignment Description
This assignment I had to make a calculator in python. It had to print out the sum, difference, product, quotient, and modulo of 2 numbers. We also had to make our own function.

N/A

### Reflection
In this assignment I got stuck a few times because I didn't know how to do a few things I already knew in java. I learned how to cut off decimals to make them cleaner, how to turn a number into a string, and how to make a function in python.
