## Python Calculator

### Assignment Description
This assignment I had to make a calculator in python. It had to print out the sum, difference, product, quotient, and modulo of 2 numbers. We also had to make our own function.

### Wiring
N/A

### Reflection
In this assignment I got stuck a few times because I didn't know how to do a few things I already knew in java. I learned how to cut off decimals to make them cleaner, how to turn a number into a string, and how to make a function in python.

## Python Quadratic Solver

### Assignment Description
This assignment I had to make a quadradic solver in python. I needed it to print out the roots of 3 numbers if they are real. If they are real it will print out the roots. If they aren't it will print out no real roots.

### Wiring
N/A

### Reflection 
In this assignment I had to learn how to square numbers in python. I had to completly restart because I forgot to save my code from yesterday on github.

## Python Strings and Loops

### Assignment Description
Today I had to make a program using strings and loops. I had to store a users sentence in a variable and split it into seperate words. Then I had to seperate the words into seperate letters and print them out.

### Wiring
N/A

### Reflection 
In this assignment I didn't have meany problems. The only big problem I had was getting the "-" to print after a word is finished. I learned how to use for loops in python and split a sentence into seperate words.

## MSP

### Assignment Description
I had to make a MSP application in python(Man Shaped Pinata). I had to make a function and use a while loop to complete this assignment. There are 2 users for this program. The first one enters a word, and the second one tries to guess it letter by letter.

### Wiring
N/A

### Reflection
In this assignment I had a problem with getting the msp drawing to show up. I tried to run the function in a couple of places then found the spot where it would print. I also had a problem where the only way the word would work is if you type the letters in the right order. I made som adjustments to the code and it works with entering the letters in any order.

## Safe Shutdown RPi

### Assignment Description
I had to wire a button and use provided code to make the raspberry pi safely turn off when the button is pressed for 4 seconds. It also had to restart when the button is just pressed down and released.

### Reflection
In this assignment we followed instructions on a canvas page. I didn't run into any problems or errors. 

## GPIO Pins I2C

### Assignment Description
I had to make an OLED screen print out the x, y, and z values from the accelerometer. The screen had to show the values changing as the accelerometer moves.

### Reflection
In this assignment I didn't have many problems with it working. The screen is printing out the values properly. The values are changing when the accelerometer moves.

## Headless Accelerometer

### Assignment Description
In this assignment I had to make the OLED screen print out 2 of the 3 values from the previous assignment. There also needed to be a circle that moves around the screen as the values change.

### Reflection
In this assignment the only problem I had was actually doing the assignment. I didn't get errors when I did it and it works properly. I made edits to my code from the assignment before to complete this one.

## Intro to CAD

### Assignment Description
In this assignment I made a skateboard using onshape. I learned how to use the "Use" tool. I also learned how to use the "Move face" tool.

### Reflection
In this assignment I didn't have many problems. I had a problem with the making the trucks more realistic part but that is it. I didn't have any problems with mates or building the skateboard parts.

## Intro to CAD - 3.1-3.4

### Assignment Description
In this assignment I learned how to make variables that help you change values faster. I also learned how to use configurations.  The configurations made it so I only had to make 1 brick but I could change it into different forms with a few drop down menus.

### Reflection 
With this assignment I didn't have any problems. The mates all worked the way they were supposed to. The configurations all worked when I tested them and I  didn't have to make changes.
