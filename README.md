### Wiring
N/A

### Reflection
In this assignment I got stuck a few times because I didn't know how to do a few things I already knew in java. I learned how to cut off decimals to make them cleaner, how to turn a number into a string, and how to make a function in python.

### Assignment Description
This assignment I had to make a quadradic solver in python. I needed it to print out the roots of 3 numbers if they are real. If they are real it will print out the roots. If they aren't it will print out no real roots.
