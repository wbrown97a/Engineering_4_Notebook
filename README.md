### Assignment Description
This assignment I had to make a calculator in python. It had to print out the sum, difference, product, quotient, and modulo of 2 numbers. We also had to make our own function.

### Wiring
N/A

### Reflection
In this assignment I got stuck a few times because I didn't know how to do a few things I already knew in java. I learned how to cut off decimals to make them cleaner, how to turn a number into a string, and how to make a function in python.

### Assignment Description
This assignment I had to make a quadradic solver in python. I needed it to print out the roots of 3 numbers if they are real. If they are real it will print out the roots. If they aren't it will print out no real roots.

### Wiring
N/A

### Reflection 
In this assignment I had to learn how to square numbers in python. I had to completly restart because I forgot to save my code from yesterday on github.

### Assignment Description
Today I had to make a program using strings and loops. I had to store a users sentence in a variable and split it into seperate words. Then I had to seperate the words into seperate letters and print them out.

### Wiring
N/A

### Reflection 
In this assignment I didn't have meany problems. The only big problem I had was getting the "-" to print after a word is finished. I learned how to use for loops in python and split a sentence into seperate words.
